# Computer Science Scholarly Data Crawler
### Introduction
This is the crawler used to crawl metadata of over 4 million computer science papers from <a href="http://academic.research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Academic Search</a> (MAS), finished in November 2012. The crawling process was for research purpose and in agreement with the crawling protocols and policies at the time.

From the crawled metadata, we also built several datasets for scientific paper recommendation experiments based on a novel <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04422.pdf">method to build ground truth data</a>.
