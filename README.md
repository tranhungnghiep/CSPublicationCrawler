# Computer Science Scholarly Data Crawler
### Introduction
This is the crawler used to crawl metadata of over 4 million computer science papers from <a href="http://academic.research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Academic Research</a> (MAS), finished in November 2012.

From the crawled metadata, we also built several datasets for scientific paper recommendation experiments based on a novel <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04422.pdf">method to build ground truth data</a>.
